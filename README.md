# PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Project's overview

PyBer is a ride-sharing application company. PyBer has all the ride-share data from January to early May of 2019. The new CEO has asked us to create a visualization of the rideshare data for PyBer to improve the access to ride-sharing services. She has also asked us to determine the affordability for developping the service in underserved neighborhoods. We have already created a visualization to highlight the relationship between the number of rides per city, the average fare, and the number of drivers per city.

PyBer has asked us to present the summary of the ride-sharing data per city type. The CEO has also asked our team to deeper our analysis with the creation of a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will then present our recommandation on the feasability to increase ride-sharing services in underserved neighborhoods.

## 2. Important differences between the ride-sharing dynamic in the rural neighborhood and the urban areas

### 2.1 PyBer's activity is centralised in the urban areas
The chart below is the summary of the ride-sharing dynamic for PyBer during the first five months of 2019. The overall analysis is that PyBer's main activity is in the urban areas:
* The urban areas count for 68,4% of the total rides in comparison with 26,3% in the suburban areas and 5,3% for the rural neighborhoods,

* The urban areas concentrate the majority of the drivers with 81% of the PyBer's drivers working in the urban areas whereas the rural neighborhood register 2,6% of the drivers.

### 2.2 PyBer's drivers are concentrated in the urban areas where the average fare per driver is extremely low
PyBer totalises 2,405 drivers in the urban areas whereas only 78 drivers work in the rural neighborhoods. The urban areas also register the higher total fares in USD between January and May 2019 with a weekly total fare between 1,500 and 2,500 USD. In the rural neighborhoods, the weekly total fare is below 500 USD.




If the urban areas have the higher number of rides, the average fare per driver is extremely low because the drivers are too numerous. The average fare per driver in the rural neighborhoods is 3,5 times higher than in the urban areas and 1,4 times higher than in the suburban areas.
