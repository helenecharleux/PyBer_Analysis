# PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Project's overview

PyBer is a ride-sharing application company. PyBer has all the ride-share data from January to early May of 2019. The new CEO has asked us to create a visualization of the rideshare data for PyBer to improve the access to ride-sharing services. She has also asked us to determine the affordability for developping the service in underserved neighborhoods. We have already created a visualization to highlight the relationship between the number of rides per city, the average fare, and the number of drivers per city.

PyBer has asked us to present the summary of the ride-sharing data per city type. The CEO has also asked our team to deeper our analysis with the creation of a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will then present our recommandation on the feasability to increase ride-sharing services in underserved neighborhoods.

## 2. Important differences between the ride-sharing dynamic in the rural neighborhood and the urban areas

### 2.1 PyBer's activity is centralised in the urban areas
The chart below is the summary of the ride-sharing dynamic for PyBer during the first five months of 2019. The overall analysis is that PyBer's main activity is in the urban areas:
* The urban areas count for 68,4% of the total rides in comparison with 26,3% in the suburban areas and 5,3% for the rural neighborhoods,

* The urban areas concentrate the majority of the drivers with 81% of the PyBer's drivers working in the urban areas whereas the rural neighborhood register 2,6% of the drivers.

### 2.2 PyBer's drivers are concentrated in the urban areas where the average fare per driver is extremely low
PyBer totalises 2,405 drivers in the urban areas whereas only 78 drivers work in the rural neighborhoods. The urban areas also register the higher total fares in USD between January and May 2019 with a weekly total fare between 1,500 and 2,500 USD. In the rural neighborhoods, the weekly total fare is below 500 USD.

If the urban areas have the higher number of rides, the average fare per driver is extremely low because the drivers are too numerous. The average fare per driver in the rural neighborhoods is 3,5 times higher than in the urban areas and 1,4 times higher than in the suburban areas.

The average fare per driver in the rural areas is around 55 USD whereas it is around 40 USD in the suburban and 17 USD in the urban areas. 

### 2.3 A higher fare per ride in the rural areas for a smaller number of drivers

The average fare per ride in the rural neighborhood is 34,62 USD in comparison with 30,97 USD in the suburb and 24,53 USD in urban areas. Because urban areas totalise 81% of the drivers, the average fare per driver is higher for those working in the rural areas. 

## 3. Recommandations: possible expansion of PyBer ride-sharing services in the rural areas

### 3.1 Rebalance the number of drivers between city types to support the number of rides in the rural areas
We have highlighted an important disparity in the number of drivers between the city types. The urban areas focuse 81% of the drivers. Only 16,5% of the drivers work in the suburban areas and 2,5% in the rural neighborhoods. With a proper communication campaign for the rural areas, it should be possible to increase the number of rides if PyBer has a higher number of drivers in those areas. 

### 3.2 Lower the fare in the rural neighborhoods to increase the total rides
In addition to higher the number of drivers working in the rural neighborhoods, we recommend to lower the ride's fare. The ride's fare in the rural areas is 1,41 times higher than in the urban areas and 1,12 times higher than in the suburban areas. Lowering the fare of the ride in the rural areas will support the increase of the number of rides in these areas. 

We also recommend PyBer to repeat these analysis in six months in order to have data for the overall year and adapt any marketing and communication strategies to any monthly specificities.
